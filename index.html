    <p>Young ma<em>N</em>, there's no need to feel down</p>
    <p>I said, young man, put your feet on the ground,</p>
    <p>I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town </p>
    <p>There's no need to be unhappy</p>
    <p>-</p>
    <p>Young man, th<em>E</em>re's a place you can go</p>
    <p>I said, young man, when you're short on your dough</p>
    <p>You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find</p>
    <p>Many ways to ha<em>V</em>e a good time</p>
    <p>-</p>

    <p>Youn<em>G</em> man, are you listening to me?</p>
    <p><em>I</em> said, young man, what do you want to be? </p>
    <p>I said, young man, you can make real your dreams</p>
    <p>But you got to know this one thing</p>
    <p>-</p>
    <p>No man does it all by himself</p>
    <p>I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf</p>
    <p>And just go there, to the YMCA</p>
    <p>I'm sure they can help you today</p>

    <p>Young man, I was <em>O</em>nce in your shoes</p>
    <p>I said, I was down and o<em>U</em>t with the blues</p>
    <p>I felt no man cared if I were alive</p>
    <p>I felt the whole world was so tight</p>
    <p>-</p>
    <p>That's when someone came <em>U</em> to me</p>
    <p>And said, young man, take a walk up the street</p>
    <p>There's a <em>P</em>lace there called the YMCA</p>
    <p>They can start you back on your way</p>
